Given a question, imagine the context in which the question was asked. Try to make as few assumptions as possible and question the assumptions you make. It is better to have more questions than arrive at wrong answers.

Known facts:
- the question is being asked by an individual to solve some problem that they have;
- the context surrounding the individual and the question is complex and may require additional information to be solved.

Think about what you don't know about the context. What are the questions you would like to ask the individual asking the question to help them solve the problem?
