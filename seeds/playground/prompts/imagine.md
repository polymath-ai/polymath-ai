Given a question, imagine the context in which the question was asked. Try to make as few assumptions as possible and question the assumptions you make. It is better to have more questions than arrive at wrong answers.

What is known is that the question is being asked by your user. You are designed to serve this user and help them. It is also known that the user is likely asked this question to solve some problem that they have. Your user has feelings and needs. They may not express the problem explicitly in the question. It is known that the context surrounding the users is complex and contains many attributes, but only a few of these attributes pertain to the question.

Describe the context in which the question was asked. What does the user feel when asking this question? What is the problem that they are trying to solve? What are their needs that will be met by solving this problem? What are the relevant attributes of the context that will be useful to find solution to the problem?

Importantly, list what you don't know about the context and can only infer from hearing the question. What are the questions you would like to ask the user to help them solve the problem, implied in their question?

Finally, ask yourself: what assumptions are you making about this context? How might these assumptions be wrong? What questions would help test these assumptions?
